  abstract = {The advent of bifacial PV systems drives new requirements for irradiance measurement at PV projects for monitoring and assessment purposes. While there are several approaches, there is still no uniform guidance for what irradiance parameters to measure and for the optimal selection and placement of irradiance sensors at bifacial arrays. Standards are emerging to address these topics but are not yet available. In this paper we review approaches to bifacial irradiance monitoring which are being discussed in the research literature and pursued in early systems, to provide a preliminary guide and framework for developers planning bifacial projects.},

  abstract = {Models predicting rear irradiance for bifacial systems are critical to establish accurate estimates of energy yield. Here, we compare fve published bifacial irradiance models, varying clearance, row spacing, tilt, and albedo to measure the sensitivity to these parameters. Bifacial energy gains (BGE) as high as 20\% are predicted for some confgurations. Model agreement is generally good for low ground clearance (clearance heights lower than 0.75 times the collector width), but at higher clearances, fnite system size and edge effects become a signifcant factor in simulations, stretching assumptions of infnite system extent made in some models. In addition, rear irradiance uniformity is improved at high ground clearance, as expected. A test-bed construction and results are described for comparison between modeled and measured data in Golden, CO, USA. The investigations indicate that model agreement for BGE calculation is better than 2\% (absolute) when compared with measured results, depending on the system confguration.},

  abstract = {The emergence of cost-competitive bifacial PV modules has raised the question of the additional value of bifacial modules in 1-axis tracking arrays, in particular when considering rear-irradiance losses from the tracker system itself. In this work, the effect of different geometries and materials of torque tubes is evaluated and found to reduce rear-irradiance averages without any torque-tube shading by 0.1 to 12\% for metallic and black absorptive torque tubes respectively for a clear-sky day. This paper will compare modeled to measured rear-irradiance profiles, and propose a recommended range of rear-shading loss factors for different geometry conditions. The effect of rear-irradiance distribution into electrical mismatch loss will also be explored.},
