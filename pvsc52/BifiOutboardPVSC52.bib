While there are several approaches, there is still no uniform guidance for what irradiance parameters to measure and for the optimal selection and placement of irradiance sensors at bifacial arrays. Standards are emerging to address these topics but are not yet available. In this paper we review approaches to bifacial irradiance monitoring which are being discussed in the research literature and pursued in early systems, to provide a preliminary guide and framework for developers planning bifacial projects.},

  abstract = {The performance of a PV system is dependent on the weather, seasonal effects, and other intermittent issues, so demonstrating that a PV system is performing as predicted requires determining that the system functions correctly under the full range of conditions relevant to the deployment site.  Currently, there is not a standard intended for quantifying performance over all ranges of weather or times of year.  This paper presents a method that is intended to address testing of a specific deployed PV system over the full range of relevant operating conditions to verify long-term expectations of energy production. The goal is a best-practice process for test development and clarify how measurement choices can affect the outcome of the test so that users can benefit from streamlined test design with consistent definitions, while still allowing flexibility in the application of the test so as to accommodate as many unique installations as possible. The paper will discuss some of the subtleties of the application of the test, including how the comparison between modeled and measured performance can become complicated when 1) the weather and system performance are intertwined in subtle ways, 2) the model is inaccurate, 3) the data analysis is ambiguous, or 4) the chosen historical weather data is not aligned with the measured data.},

  abstract = {Models predicting rear irradiance for bifacial systems are critical to establish accurate estimates of energy yield. Here, we compare fve published bifacial irradiance models, varying clearance, row spacing, tilt, and albedo to measure the sensitivity to these parameters. Bifacial energy gains (BGE) as high as 20\% are predicted for some confgurations. Model agreement is generally good for low ground clearance (clearance heights lower than 0.75 times the collector width), but at higher clearances, fnite system size and edge effects become a signifcant factor in simulations, stretching assumptions of infnite system extent made in some models. In addition, rear irradiance uniformity is improved at high ground clearance, as expected. A test-bed construction and results are described for comparison between modeled and measured data in Golden, CO, USA. The investigations indicate that model agreement for BGE calculation is better than 2\% (absolute) when compared with measured results, depending on the system confguration.},

In this work, the effect of different geometries and materials of torque tubes is evaluated and found to reduce rear-irradiance averages without any torque-tube shading by 0.1 to 12\% for metallic and black absorptive torque tubes respectively for a clear-sky day. This paper will compare modeled to measured rear-irradiance profiles, and propose a recommended range of rear-shading loss factors for different geometry conditions. The effect of rear-irradiance distribution into electrical mismatch loss will also be explored.},
