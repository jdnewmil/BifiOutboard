abstract: |
  This paper presents a strategy for evaluating bifacial photovoltaic (PV) system power capacity while avoiding sensor placement within localized rear-side irradiance gradients by regressing power versus measurements from front plane-of-array sensors,  outboard rear-facing sensors, ambient temperature and wind speed sensors. The expected readings for the outboard rear-facing sensor are not supplied directly by PVsyst, but can be computed based on existing PVsyst model outputs. The focus in this paper is on horizontal single-axis-tracking arrays, as these have more complex reference conditions preparation than fixed-tilt arrays.

# Introduction {#sec-intro}

[C]{.IEEEPARstart}[haracterization]{} of PV power generating system capacity using the ASTM2848 test procedure [@astm2848.2023] is widely implemented in acceptance test protocols for photovoltaic (PV) power systems, with ASTM2939 [@e44committeeStandardPracticeDetermining2023] typically referenced to determine reporting conditions. However, these procedures were developed and tested when photovoltaic modules were designed to only convert irradiant power incident on one side (monofacial). Monofacial construction allowed a single outboard plane-of-array (POA) pyranometer timeseries to represent the average incident irradiation available to the PV module array for most cases, which in turn allowed the total input power to the array (before internal shading) to be quantified in the field by multiplication of total module area with measured irradiance. While actual field conditions might vary such that any particular set of input conditions (POA irradiance, ambient temperature, and wind speed) do not occur during an equipment evaluation or in a simulated equipment operation, ASTM2848 defines a regression equation that allows exactly the same input conditions to be specified identically for the simulated performance and the observed performance. The irradiance measurements typically associated with such PV system capacity tests are adjacent to and coplanar with (outboard from) the plane of modules in a row within an array in a location with minimal shade impact. The rationale for using this independent variable is that the power prediction model should be able to properly predict the power reduction due to diffuse shading, but it is impractical to compare the model to field conditions when there is direct irradiance shading on the array so such records are excluded from the evaluation data.

The widespread introduction of bifacial PV modules to the market in the 2010s lead to a variety of approaches to quantify the additional input power from the rear side of the modules, but the key assumption that a pyranometer could be placed in a location that would be representative for the whole rear side of the PV module array is difficult to defend. McIntosh et. al. 2019 [@mcintoshEffectNonuniformIllumination2019] demonstrated that the incident rear-side irradiance on single-axis trackers is far from uniform on the rear side of the PV module array, and that the non-uniformity varies with time as well. That is, any specific location that might be representative of the spatial average rear side irradiance value at one time of day may not be relied on to serve that purpose at another time of day. This particularly makes identification of excessive rear-side structural shading difficult, since mounting a pyranometer in the plane of the rear transparent cover between two modules may lead to an excessively-low estimate of rear-side irradiance leading to an over-estimate of power plant power conversion capacity. Moving the pyranometer until it is coplanar with the purlins/module frame will avoid the overly-conservative shaded measurement but then excessive torque tube and support shading will still not be identified.

Pelaez et. al. 2019 [@pelaezEffectTorquetubeParameters2019] suggested placement of rear facing sensors at 20% and 80% positions along a horizontal single-axis-tracker (HSAT) row transverse dimension and using the average of these two sensors to estimate average irradiance intensity. This approach addresses long-term average spatial variations, but does not address the short-term spatial irradiance change with time of day illustrated by McIntosh et. al. 2019 [@mcintoshEffectNonuniformIllumination2019] that would dominate measurements made during a capacity test conducted over several days, nor does it address the issues associated with various sources of structural shading that are mentioned above.

This paper develops "Approach 3" described in Gostein et. al. 2021 [@gosteinMeasuringIrradianceBifacial2021] that continues with the monofacial front-side POA irradiance measurement philosophy by placing a rear-facing sensor in an outboard position. This allows the system capacity evaluation to be sensitive to deviations in the field from the modeled structural shading and allows sensor placement in a location that has smaller spatial gradients of irradiance. This reduces the sensitivity to sensor placement, and maintains a consistent boundary of evaluation (as discussed in Kurtz et. al. [@kurtzPVSystemEnergy2014]) with monofacial capacity testing practices. @fig-boundaries expands on the issue of boundaries, highlighting potential equivalencies betweeen simulation results and sensor locations for field irradiance measurements. If $\mathtt{GlobBak}$ is used, the result will be insensitive to rear structural shading, and the sensors cannot average over the strong local shading near the module frame. $\mathtt{GlobBakFrame}$ is not computed separately, and even if it was it would makes the test insensitive to support structure shading. $\mathtt{GlobBakUnshd}$ is computable (see \eqref{eq:globbakunshd}), but has no definite sensor location. For HSAT arrays, a rear-facing outboard sensor will be exposed to higher irradiance levels than the average irradiance on the rear side of the array, but having a linear relationship with the average irradiance allows such a sensor to act as a surrogate for average rear irradiance which this paper derives.

![Possible irradiance boundaries](diagrams/boundaries.pdf){#fig-boundaries}

The fact that separate mechanisms affect the front and rear irradiance paths means that the capacity test regression equations for bifacial use should allow for separate front and rear coefficients. We propose that \eqref{eq:e2848bifi} be used in conjunction with the outboard measurement discussed in this paper:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e2848bifi}
\begin{aligned}
P &= (E_\mathrm{front} + E_\mathrm{rear}) \\
  &\cdot \left(
  a_1
  + a_\mathrm{2a} E_\mathrm{front}
  + a_\mathrm{2b} E_\mathrm{rear}
  + a_3 T_\mathrm{a}
  + a_4 v
  \right)
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
where the changes to the existing standard equation are that the total available irradiance is used as multiplier, and the front and rear irradiance terms are separate in the regression.

# Approach

This work focuses on deriving an estimate of the HSAT outboard sensor reading from standard PVsyst modeling results, and illustrates obtaining the target power capacity estimate. 

A broadly-used result in diffuse irradiance models is the "wedge" equation (e.g. Equation B-71 from Siegel @siegelThermalRadiationHeat1981), which integrates an assumed uniformly-distributed (isotropic) irradiance source emanating from a portion of the inside of a hemisphere toward a central receiving differential area where each incident differential ray is diluted by the cosine of the incidence angle. For two planes intersecting at an angle $\phi$ as in @fig-wedge, the two wedges divide the hemispherical incident irradiance according to \eqref{eq:e-wedge-psi}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-wedge-psi}
\frac{E_{\mathrm{wedge,}\psi}}{E_{\mathrm{hemisphere}}} = \frac{1-\cos{\psi}}{2}
\end{equation}
This result applies even if the originating surfaces are more complex than a hemisphere, so long as the angular density of the irradiance is uniform as it passes the hemisphere boundary.

![Example "irradiance wedge"](diagrams/down_view_wedgeonly.pdf){#fig-wedge}

If the deviations from irradiance uniformity are not large, then the wedge equation can provide a useful approximate solution for modeling even for somewhat non-uniform irradiance.

## PVsyst rear-side irradiance modeling

According to the software documentation [@mermoudPVsystHelp2023], PVsyst currently employs a view-factor approach to estimating average irradiance across the rear side of the PV array, modified to account for estimated structural shading. The PVsyst rear irradiance model assumes infinitely-long rows, so there is no "end effect" where bright ground at the row end increases the rear-side irradiance close to the end of the row. An outboard sensor is significantly affected by such effects but is not affected by the structural shading, so our goal is to identify which PVsyst results are most comparable with various capacity test sensor placements, and in particular the outboard placement.

PVsyst does not provide detailed information on calculation steps used, but between documentation and trial-and-error, a high-level calculation sequence can be identified. The PVsyst calculation begins by computing an estimate for a spatially-averaged irradiance on the ground below the trackers as $\mathtt{GlobGnd}$. This calculation accounts for the reduction in direct irradiance into strips between the rows, as well as obstruction of diffuse irradance. This average is then multiplied by ground albedo to get an estimate of spatially-averaged upwelling irradiance under the array. This horizontal upwelling irradiance is then converted to a tilted orientation by dividing by GCR. Then a portion of that irradiance that escapes upward to the sky between the rows ($\mathtt{BkVFLss}$ estimated by view-factor geometry) is subtracted to obtain the internally-computed component of rear irradiance $E_\mathrm{pvsyst,rear,gnd}$ originating from the ground. The component of rear side diffuse irradiance originating from the sky $\mathtt{DifSBak}$ is computed from the isotropic diffuse using the wedge formula less near shade, and an average near shade impact from adjacent rows is subtracted. $\mathtt{BeamBak}$ is reported by PVsyst as the direct irradiance incident on the rear side, which is typically zero for single-axis trackers. In general the pre-structural-shade rear irradiance estimate obtained by PVsyst is:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e_pvsyst_rear}
E_\mathrm{pvsyst,rear} = E_\mathrm{pvsyst,rear,gnd} + \mathtt{DifSBak} + \mathtt{BeamBak}
\end{equation}
and then obtains the final estimate of rear side irradiance as in \eqref{eq:globbak}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:globbak}
\mathtt{GlobBak} = E_\mathrm{pvsyst,rear} - \mathtt{BackShd}
\end{equation}
where $\mathtt{BackShd}$ is the irradiance estimated as being blocked by array and module structural members or other interference.

The PVsyst $\mathtt{GlobBak}$ output is a naive candidate for comparison with sensors, but this quantity represents a _spatial average_ irradiance that is also _obstructed by structural shading_ objects. So an unobstructed average irradiance could be
\begin{equation}\label{eq:globbakunshd}
\begin{aligned}
\mathtt{GlobBakUnshd} &= \mathtt{GlobBak} + \mathtt{BackShd} \\
&\stackrel{?}{=} E_\mathrm{pvsyst,rear}
\end{aligned}
\end{equation}
except that there is no clear sensor location corresponding to this simulated value within the varying shade conditions behind the array, and as the measurement location moves further from the center of the array more unshaded ground comes into view of the sensor. 

## Outboard irradiance sensor estimation

@fig-views illustrates the sun geometry of a single axis tracker at the end closest to the equator. An outboard rear-facing irradiance sensor is located at an offset distance $L$ beyond the end of the torque-tube at height $H$ in the direction of the equator. The edge of a block of trackers casts an approximate "shade line" on the ground in the east-west direction, disregarding the sawtooth pattern arising from tracker tilt and the interruptions due to tracker row spacing.

The shade angle $\phi$ projected into the north-south-vertical plane can be obtained by projecting the cosine of the PVsyst sun elevation angle $\mathtt{HSol}$ using the cosine of the PVsyst azimuth angle $\mathtt{AzSol}$ as in \eqref{eq:cos_phi}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:cos_phi}
\cos{\phi} = \cos{\left(\mathtt{AzSol}\right)} \cos{\left(\mathtt{HSol}\right)}
\end{equation}
Note that the planar shade angle $\phi$ in this diagram is different than the PVsyst $\mathtt{PhiAng}$) tracker rotation angle.

The unshaded ground wedge angle $\psi$ can be computed using either \eqref{eq:psi-atan2}
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi-atan2}
\tan{\psi} = \frac{H \sin{\phi}}{L \sin{\phi} + H \cos{\phi}}
\end{equation}
or equivalently using \eqref{eq:psi_acos}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:psi_acos}
\psi = \cos^{-1}{\left(\frac
{L \sin{\phi} + H \cos{\phi}}
{\sqrt{L^2 \sin^2{\phi} + 2 L H \sin{\phi} \cos{\phi} + H^2}}\right)}
\end{equation}
because only two quadrants are of interest.

With $\psi$ computed, the relative weighting factor $W$ of the unshaded ground can be computed as in \eqref{eq:w} directly from \eqref{eq:e-wedge-psi}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:w}
W = \tfrac{1+\cos{\psi}}{2}
\end{equation}

The diffuse irradiance upwelling from the unshaded ground is just the albedo times the global horizontal irradiance (neglecting the diffuse shading below point $B$), or $E_\mathrm{upwelling,unshaded}=\mathtt{GlobHor} \cdot \mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near}$. The diffuse irradiance from the unshaded portion of the ground on a down-facing outboard sensor ($E_\mathrm{gnd,nadir,unshaded}$) may be approximated as irradiance from an isotropic wedge from a nadir-facing hemisphere that omits the row-shaded (north-south shade striped) portion of the ground on the far side of the "shade line" using \eqref{eq:e-gnd-nadir-unshaded}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-gnd-nadir-unshaded}
E_\mathrm{gnd,nadir,unshaded} = W \cdot \mathtt{GlobHor} \cdot \mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near}
\end{equation}

Once the outboard sensor rotates with the tracker (as in @fig-offset-roll) then the visible portion of the unshaded ground will be further reduced by a perpendicular wedge slice arising from the row rotation. While not an exact calculation because both unshaded and shaded irradiance is involved, the shading wedge fraction can be multiplied by the tracking rotation wedge fraction as in \eqref{eq:e-gnd-rear-unshaded} with less than 1% relative error for most cases, which is on the order of a 0.01% absolute error due to the rear-side energy contribution typically being on the order of 10% of the front-side irradiance contribution.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-gnd-rear-unshaded}
E_\mathrm{gnd,rear,unshaded} = W \cdot \mathtt{GlobHor} \cdot \mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near} \cdot \tfrac{1 + \cos{\mathtt{PhiAng}}}{2}
\end{equation}

The remaining contribution from the ground arises from the stripes of unshaded and shaded ground north of the east-west "shade line". PVsyst provides the estimate of average downward irradiance underneath the array (including unshaded stripes) as $\mathtt{GlobGnd}$ which incorporates direct and diffuse shade obstruction from the moving trackers. The reflected irradiance is $\mathtt{GlobGnd} \cdot \mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near}$, and the intensity is scaled to the tracker tilt using the ratio of ground area to module area, which is equivalent to dividing by GCR. The upwelling shaded irradiance that misses the trackers (lost to the sky) is $\mathtt{BkVFLss}$. Thus, without applying any wedge calculations PVsyst estimates the raw (prior to structural shading) irradiance available to the rear side from the ground as in \eqref{eq:e-gnd-rear-shaded-average}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-gnd-rear-shaded-average}
E_\mathrm{gnd,rear,shaded,average} = \mathtt{GlobGnd} \cdot \tfrac{\mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near}}{\mathrm{GCR}} - \mathtt{BkVFLss}
\end{equation}

From the perspective of the outboard sensor, only a fraction of the irradiance received from the ground arises from shaded ground, so we multiply by $(1-W)$ as in \eqref{eq:e-gnd-rear-shaded}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-gnd-rear-shaded}
E_\mathrm{gnd,rear,shaded} = (1 - W) \cdot \left(\mathtt{GlobGnd} \cdot \tfrac{\mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near}}{\mathrm{GCR}} - \mathtt{BkVFLss} \right)
\end{equation}

The shaded and unshaded contributions are added to estimate the irradiance from the ground as in \eqref{eq:e-gnd-rear}:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-gnd-rear}
E_\mathrm{gnd,rear} =
E_\mathrm{gnd,rear,unshaded} + E_\mathrm{gnd,rear,shaded}
\end{equation}

The diffuse irradiance from the sky can be modeled by combining the ground, sky, and beam contributions:
\begin{equation}\label{eq:e-rear}
E_\mathrm{rear} = E_\mathrm{gnd,rear} + \mathtt{DifSBak} + \mathtt{BmIncBk}
\end{equation}
where $\mathtt{DifSBak}$ and $\mathtt{BmIncBk}$ are as computed by PVsyst.

# Results

@fig-e-rear-tilt compares the computed $E_\mathrm{rear}$ versus the naive $\mathtt{GlobBakUnshd}$ for a sample system with $H=2\mathrm{m}$, $\mathrm{albedo}_\mathrm{near}=0.2$, and $\mathrm{GCR}=0.493$, colored to indicate tilt angle.  When the sensor offset position is far "Under" the tracker ($L=-100\mathrm{m}$) then the values are essentially identical. When the sensor position is "Outboard" ($L=1\mathrm{m}$), then the estimated $E_\mathrm{rear}$ is approximately double the under-the-tracker value for this configuration.

```{python}
#|  label: fig-e-rear-tilt

(
  p9.ggplot(
    bdta_aug.reset_index()
    , p9.aes(x='GlobBakUnshd', y='E_rear', color='Tilt')
  )
  + p9.geom_point(size=1, alpha=0.2)
  + p9.geom_abline(linetype='dashed')
  + p9.facet_wrap('~ Position', ncol=2)
  + p9.coord_fixed(ratio=0.7)

    , color=r'$\mathtt{Tilt}~\left[{}^\circ \right]$'
  )
)
```

The linear relationship between $\mathtt{GlobBakUnshd}$ and $E_\mathrm{rear}$ at higher rear irradiance levels allows the outboard value to be used as a proxy for the inboard "average" value in the regression equation. While the coefficients obtained by directly using $E_\mathrm{rear}$ will be reduced by the proportionality with $\mathtt{GlobBakUnshd}$, as long as we are comparing field measured outboard and simulated outboard data and reference conditions, the computed capacity values should also be the same, and the obtained capacity values can be compared just as in a simple monofacial capacity test.

# Conclusions

We have derived an approach for obtaining a simulated sensor reading for an outboard rear-facing sensor on an HSAT PV array using outputs available from the commonly-used PVsyst energy production estimation software that is directly comparable with an equivalent instrument mounted in the field. This maintains a test boundary that allows the capacity test to identify deviations in structural shade and module bifaciality separately from near shade impacts on the front side.
